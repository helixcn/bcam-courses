# Aims of this course

The course will provide basic knowledge and abilities for using `R` as a work environment. To this end, the course will give an overview of tools offered by `R`, e.g. handling of matrices and data-sets, graphical illustrations, statistical tests and analyses, and programming in `R`. The aim is that in the end of the course everyone has reached some familiarity with `R`, and is able to continue working with it and search for help for more advanced `R` features.

# Pre-required knowledge

No background knowledge about `R` or advance programming is needed. Some background knowledge on basic statistics is needed as **this course will not teach statistics**.
