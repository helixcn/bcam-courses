# Aims of this course

The course will provide basic knowledge and abilities for using `R` as a work environment. To this end, the course will give an overview of tools offered by `R`, e.g. handling of matrices and data-sets, graphical illustrations, statistical tests and analyses, and programming in `R`. The aim is that in the end of the course everyone has reached some familiarity with `R`, and is able to continue working with it and search for help for more advanced `R` features.

# Pre-required knowledge

No background knowledge about `R` or advance programming is needed. Some background knowledge on basic statistics is needed as <span style="color:red">this course will NOT teach statistics.</span>  <span style="color:red">All the students must bring their own laptops.</span>

  6. Case studies and examples
      
       * [The German Credit data set](http://idaejin.github.io/bcam-courses/R/2017/GermanCreditData.R) contains observations on 30 variables for 1000 past applicants for credit. Each applicant was rated as “good credit” (700 cases) or “bad credit” (300 cases).
  
      * [Boston Housing data](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html) contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. Load `library(MASS)` and `data("Boston")`, see `?Boston` for details.
      
      * [Wine data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine) is the result of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines. Load `library(rattle)` and `data(wine)`, see `?wine` for details.
